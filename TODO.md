TODO:

- Implement seeding!!
- Implement height modifiers
- Implement color modifiers
- Save the real array of floats data, the cube_data in its raw form into binary files
  so that in future there can be a code that looks at it and reads backs the height from the data
  it will be so useful! no more roundtrip to the gpu!!
